## Carbon Design System

To go faster and because it's a great Design System, all the components are coming from [IBM's Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).

Here is the original repository

- **Carbon React components**: [https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/react)

Only a subset has been used here. And some pieces of code have been adapted to use less babel plugins.

Storybook stories have also been adapted to use the new [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/).
